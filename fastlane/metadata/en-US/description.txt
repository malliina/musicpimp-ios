Enjoy music with MusicPimp, the ultimate music app. Play music from your library on your phone, any PC, your home stereo system or in your car.  

Enjoy MusicPimp in any of the following ways:

- Make your library of MP3s on your PC available for playback on your phone. The music is streamed over mobile networks or WLAN.

- Play music stored on your home PC on your Bluetooth-enabled car stereo system. Your music is streamed over mobile networks to your phone and to your car stereo over Bluetooth.

- Stream music from your MusicPimp server through the cloud to your phone. No need to configure IP addresses or port forwarding.

- Use the MusicPimp server as an alarm clock. Schedule any track in your library for playback every morning, then receive a push notification to your phone when the track plays. Tapping the notification stops playback.
